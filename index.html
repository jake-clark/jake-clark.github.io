									<h2>My Research</h2>
								</header>
								
								
								<p>I want to try and answer one of humankind's greatest mysteries; Are we alone? I am currently a PhD Candidate based at the University of Southern Queensland's Toowoomba campus, in sunny Queensland, Australia. My PhD research improves the stellar and planetary characteristics of known and newly discovered planets and the stars that host them. Not only do I want to improve the physical characteristics of these stars and planets, but I also want to know what these planets are actually made out of. Are they made of fairy floss? A whole planet made out of Vegemite? Okay... that's a bit ridiculous, but we can actually detect the amount of rocky material within a host star's atmosphere and then use this as a proxy of the rocky material that these planets could comprise of! From this information, we can make better informed decisions to see if these exoplanets could be terrestrial-like in composition, and thus a better sense of whether life could exist on these alien worlds.<br /><br />

								As of December 2019, astronomers have discovered over 4,100 exoplanets beyond our solar system. Unfortunately, with the two main methods we use to detect these fascinating worlds, all we tend to see is indirect evidence of a planet. We either see a periodic dip in the host stars' light or light spectrum shift as the planet's gravitational pull tugs on the star. With these two measurements alone, you can roughly determine the geological and chemical composition of rocky terrestrial worlds known as super-Earths or small gassy worlds known as sub-Neptunes. But, what if we could do better than that? What other information can we pull out of these two measurements alone to help us better understand the fundamental structure of these worlds? Well, the gravitational tug method discussed above, known as the Radial Velocity technique, utilises precise measurements of a star’s spectrum. This spectrum encodes the chemical abundances of the star, showcasing the distribution of different materials within it, particularly the amount of planet-building elements like silicon, iron, magnesium and other elements found within a planet hosting star. We can then assume that the star and planets that it hosts were made from the same ginormous gas cloud, and thus we can then use the stellar abundances to then infer the compositions of super-Earths and sub-Neptune worlds! If you'd like to know more about this, I'd highly recommend checking out the works from <a href="https://carolinedorn.ch/">Caroline Dorn</a> and <a href="http://www.caymanunterborn.com">Cayman Unterborn</a>

								<h3>Hunting for exoplanets</h3>
								<br />
								
								<iframe width="100%" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnX7ExBjrHw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />
								
								<p>During my PhD, I've been incredibly fortunate assisting in the commissioning of MinERVA-Australis. MinERVA-Australis the Southern Hemisphere's only dedicated observatory assisting in NASA's new planet-finding mission, TESS. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite">TESS</a> is a space-based observatory that's scouring the entire night sky for exoplanets. These planets are then confirmed using ground-based observatories such as MinERVA-Australis based in regional Queensland, Australia. Five 0.7 m telescopes at the facility can either work in unison or independently that can either all point at faint targets or observe multiple bright stars all at the same time! Since the commissioning phase, I've been one of the key observers for the project, snaring the discovery of four exoplanets thus far! On top of all of this, I also use the observatory to obtain high-precision chemical abundances of host stars that help me work out what their planets could potentially be made out of.</p>

								<h3>Redefining Known Exoplanetary Systems</h3><br />
									<p>The size and mass of an exoplanet hinge entirely on its host star. When astronomers and astrophysicists alike discover a brand-new world, in most cases we've determined the mass and radius of the exoplanet based upon how big and massive its host star is. In some cases, the fundamental properties stars, including their mass and size can be as large as 100%. That means the size of some stars could be twice as big, or tinier than a pin!! This error than translates back to the planet's properties. We need to accurately determine how large and how massive smaller worlds are, if we have any hope of sending back ET's phone bill. My PhD in part redefines the stellar mass, radius, age of thousands of stars, but I've also assisted in analysing and redefining hundreds of exoplanetary systems discovered by TESS's predecessor, the K2-mission. We've used high resolution spectra from the HERMES spectrograph upon the AAT to precisely determine the mass and radii of planet hosting stars down to an error of 5%!</p>

								<p>If you haven't realised by now, I. LOVE. SPACE!! And I love talking about it as much as I do researching it. Currently, I'm the Student Representative for the Astronomical Society of Australia's <a href="http://asaepoc.org/roles/">Education and Public Outreach Chapter</a> and way back in 2016, I received the opportunity of a lifetime, running away and joining the circus... the <a href="https://www.questacon.edu.au/outreach/programs/science-circus">Questacon Science Circus</a>. The Science Circus is a practical Master's degree in Science Communication Outreach, run jointly by Questacon, the National Science and Technology Centre, and the Australian National University. I travelled all around Australia, presenting engaging STEM shows to primary and high school students. This experience definitely honed my science communication skills, which are invaluable for any modern-day scientist!

								<p>
								Throughout 2019, I was the lead PI for an Advanced Queensland Engaging Science grant, where I travelled across regional South East Queensland, getting junior primary students to dance through the solar system and build their very own alien worlds from dough. In the coming months, I'll have my <a href="https://advance.qld.gov.au/engaging-science-grants-recipients">Build-A-Planet</a> activities up on the astronomy education resource website <a href="https://astroedu.iau.org/en/">astroEDU</a>. My main outreach activities currently revolve around the University of Southern Queensland's <a href="https://www.usq.edu.au/hes/school-of-sciences/mt-kent-observatory/astronomy-for-schools">Astronomy for Schools and Communities</a> program. It's an incursion-based program where we travel around to different schools around regional Queensland, showing off our immaculate dark, regional skies with portable and easily accessible telescopes. In mid-2019, The Conversation ran its first <a href="https://www.usq.edu.au/study/faculty-events/2019/07/festival-of-astronomy/curious-kids-talk">Curious Kids</a> night at USQ, where I got to talk to a room full of budding scientists about bags of poo on the Moon and oceans of liquid "farts" on Uranus... it was LOADS of fun!
								<br/><br/>
								Some of my other outreach escapades including presenting my science at numerous events across Australia including <a href="https://pintofscience.com.au/event/starry-starry-nights">Pint of Science</a>, Gold Coast Skeptics Club annual <a href="https://www.gcskeptics.com/single-post/2019/03/24/Darwin-Day-2019">Darwin Day</a>, <a href="https://scipubtas.org.au/blog/2018/08/14/science-at-nasa/"> Science in the Pub Tasmania</a> and up to Outback Queensland for the Queensland Government's <a href="http://www.wonderofscience.com.au/flying-scientists">Flying Scientists program</a> to name a few.

									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								
								<p>
								
								I'm a proud South Aussie, hailing from the character building northern suburbs of Adelaide. Growing up in such an environment, I had no role models around me whom had even finished high school, let alone gone off to get a university degree. But, my passion to explore the cosmos broke this social barrier and, well ... started from the bottom now we're here! Oh yeah by the way, my brain is filled with four major topics; astrophysics, music lyrics, sports statistics and obscure Simpsons references.
								</p>
								
								<header><h3>Tunes</h3></header>
								
								<p>
								Music, and in particular "heavy" music, has been my vice ever since early High School. Moshing about in a mosh pit is very cathartic for me personally, but I completely understand that it's not for everyone! I've had the absolute privilege back at Radio Adelaide to interview some of my biggest idols including Slayer, Killswitch Engage, Parkway Drive, A Day To Remember, Protest The Hero and more. If you'd like to know more about the tunes I dig, I've created a Spotify playlist below which will show you how similar, or maybe dissimilar our tastes in music are.
								</p>
								
								<header><h3>Sportsball</h3></header>
								
								<p>
								My wardrobe only offers two variants, band shirts and sports jerseys. If I'm not headbanging to some heavy earworms, you'll probably see me barracking for ALL of the sportsballs. Favourite teams include Port Adelaide Power (AFL), South Adelaide (SANFL), St. George Illawarra (NRL), Baltimore Ravens (NFL), Houston Astros (MLB), Toronto Raptors (NBA) and Liverpool (EPL) to name a few. And if I'm not watching sport, you'll see me playing AFL for the mighty University Cougars. GO COUGS!!

									<h2>How do Stellar Surveys Like GALAH Improve Our Understanding of Planetary Systems?</h2>
									<p><p><p>
									<h3>Jake Clark, Natalie Hinkel, Rob Wittenmyer, Jonti Horner, Duncan Wright, Brad Carter, Cayman Unterborn, Mathieu Clerte, and the GALAH Collaboration</h3>
									<p>
									So here’s the low down. You’ve just sat down at your desk on a Monday morning. The smell of coffee permeates through the room as you slowly scroll through the hundreds of emails you’ve received during the weekend. But one single notification stands out… TESS has just dropped some hot off-the-press candidates. Some are located in the Southern sky, your favourite hemisphere! But, you want to know more about the physical and chemical characteristics of these candidate host’s... where do you begin to look? Well, we’ve got you fam!
									<p>
									I’m going to try and summarise the last four years of my life in one interactive poster… so strap yourself in.
									<p><h3>WHY GALAH? WELL, WHY NOT!</h3><p>
									Involving fewer shovels and more optical fibres, galactic archeology is a growing sub-field in astronomy, aiming to better understand the formation and evolution of our home galaxy, the Milky Way. Galactic archeology surveys are huge stellar surveys, with rich data sets containing both the physical and chemical properties of stars contained within our galaxy (and sometimes even beyond).
									<p>
									As you can see with the plot below, the overlap between the TESS sectors, in orange, and stars observed with Australia’s Galactic Archeology with HERMES survey (GALAH), in purple, is incredible. So why not utilise these big surveys to further characterise current and future TESS planetary systems with GALAH? Sounds like a no brainer to me!
									<figure>
									<img src="images/SKYTESSGALAH.png" style="width:100%" class="center">
									<figcaption><i>How beautiful is this overlap Huh?!</i></figcaption>
									</figure><br/>
									<p><h3>WHAT TYPES OF ROCKY WORLDS IS TESS LIKELY TO FIND?</h3><p>
									Now that is a cool question to try to answer. The answer to this question can be found below. But the TL;DR is: Around half of the rocky worlds found by TESS will likely have geological compositions unlike any object found within our Solar System!!
									<p>
									You’re probably thinking, Jake and team, how did you work that one out?! Well, here goes the recipe list, without the doom scrolling of me verbosely describing how I made the cosmic cake before the actual cake recipe.
									<p><b>Ingredients:</b><p>
									<ul>
									<li>Spectral properties from GALAH’s Second Data Release (Teff, logg and [M/H]*) (* see graph below for some real talk about our little friend [M/H])</li>
									<li>Photometric magnitudes for these stars, including GAIA (G, GR, GB), 2MASS (J, H, Ks) and V </li>
									<li>Parallax values from GAIA DR2</li>
									<li>Python package iscochrones</li>
									<li>Cross-matching package TOPCAT</li>
									</ul>
									<p><b>Recipe:</b><p>
									<ol>
									<li>Obtain GALAH’s second data release (https://datacentral.org.au/teamdata/GALAH/public/GALAH_DR2/)</li>
									<li>Cross match the GALAH catalog with GAIA DR2 and the TESS Input Catalog within the software TOPCAT, keeping the stars with the highest SNR* (more detail in our paper)</li>
									<li>Use the spectral, photometric and astrometric properties from GALAH, GAIA and the TIC above as input for isochrones</li>
									<li>Obtain mass, radius, luminosity, habitable zones etc. for over 47,000+ stars</li>
									</ol>
									<p>
									And voila, you've just created the GALAH-TESS catalouge! If you'd like to get your hands on some freshly squeezed science, both the
									
									<a href="https://datacentral.org.au/teamdata/GALAH/public/GALAH_DR2/VAC/GALAH_TESS/">data</a> and 
									
									<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab1052">paper</a> are now publicly available!
									
									<p><h3>PSA about "Metals"</h3><p>
									<p>
									Real talk for a second though. As a member of the astronomical community, I know that we love making our lives simple. Some simplifications include; always searching for log-log relationships, assuming PETA doesn’t know about our obsession with spherical cows in a vacuum and more importantly, assuming the periodic table only contains hydrogen, helium and “metals”.
									<p>
									This assumption really breaks down for our iron-poor and alpha-rich thicc disk friends (which you can’t tell if the star is a thin or thick boi just based upon their iron-abundance alone) and can have disastrous effects on your isochrone results. We’ve all been there, lessons learnt! Just remember [Fe/H] != [M/H].
									<p>
									<figure>
									<img src="images/mh.png" style="width:100%"/>
									<figcaption><i>The TIC has directly incorporated GALAH’s [Fe/H] values as [M/H]. For our [M/H] values, we have also incorporated [alpha/Fe] values. As you can see for alpha-rich, thick disc stars, the difference can be as large as 0.5 dex!</i></figcaption>
									</figure><br/>
									<p><h3>WHEN IS AN EARTH-LIKE WORLD NOT EARTH-LIKE?</h3><p>
									
									One of the coolest realisations during my PhD is knowing the sheer diversity of stellar interior, photospheric and isochrone models that are out there and available to planetary astrophysicists and astronomers like ourselves. These various models can change the calculated physical properties of the stars being derived, depending upon what models you choose.
									<p>
									As you’re probably well aware, we don’t directly measure the mass or radius of the planets we discover. We calculate a planet’s mass and radius through the relative relationships between a star and planets’ mass and radius. Thus if the stellar properties change, then so do the planet’s.
									<p>
									So I wanted to test something, a kinda cool experiment as it were. What if you discovered THE first Earth-massed and Earth-sized exoplanet. You’ve used the GALAH-TESS catalogue because you know how awesome and comprehensive it is to determine the mass and radius of this planet. BUT, what if you used the stellar parameters from the TIC instead. How different would your “Earth-like” world be?
									<p>
									<figure>
									<img src="images/earthlike.png" style="width:100%"/>
									<figcaption><i>The spread of our “Earth-like” world stretches to worlds made from solid iron to water dominated worlds. </i></figcaption>
									</figure><br/>
									<p>
									As you can see from the graph above, your “Earth-like” world would now be a various mix of different compositions. Some of these would have extremely questionable compositions required for life as we know it. I’m not saying that one method of deriving stellar parameters is better or worse than the other in this comparison. I’m just trying to show that consistent stellar parameters from various sources matter when you’re trying to determine the characteristics of exoplanetary systems.
